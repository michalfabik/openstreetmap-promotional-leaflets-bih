This repository contains the source files for an OSM flyer (in English) that was
originally created by Frederik Ramm <frederik@remote.org> and
contributors from the talk-de list in January 2008, and subsequently
updated, translated, re-updated and re-translated over the
years. This version was made by Andy Allan <andy@gravitystorm.co.uk>

All contents are in the public domain except for those derived from OSM
which are CC BY-SA, and except for non-OSM logos.

The flyer is designed for DIN A7 as the final size (105mm high and
74mm wide), with 8 pages in a zig-zag ("Leporello") fold, and full
colour printing.

The flyer was made with Inkscape; osmflyer1.svg and osmflyer2.svg
are the front and reverse side.

Some notes in case you want to re-create something yourself:

* `berlin-background.png` is basically a 4-year-old Osmarender rendering
of Berlin, using a standard stylesheet but with all captions removed,
and the resulting PNG file processed with the Gimp roughly like this:

  First convert to grayscale, then use `colors->curves` to narrow down
contrast, then convert back to RGB, then use `colors->colorify` to give
it a nice hue.

* The cover globe image was made with Marble, the technique is roughly
outlined here: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Marble

* To generate the high-res png maps, use the following commands
`~/src/nik2img/nik2img.py -d 2479 1356 -z 14 -c -0.128056 51.508056 --scale-factor 3 ~/src/openstreetmap-carto/osm-carto.xml london.png`
`~/src/nik2img/nik2img.py -d 1974 2902 -z 15 -c -3.19864 55.95 --scale-factor 3 ~/src/openstreetmap-carto/osm-carto.xml edinburgh.png`
